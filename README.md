## Abstract

One of the most significant challenges in cybersecurity today is the risk posed by insider threats. This research addresses the exponential growth of network usage and the susceptibility of internet consumers to exploitation. Malware attacks are a major concern in the digital world, requiring specialized detection techniques. In this study, a machine learning algorithm using a neural network is proposed to enhance malware detection accuracy in response to insider threats. The proposed workflow includes feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification. The CERT4.2 dataset is used, and data preprocessing involves encoding text strings and differentiating threat and non-threat records. The developed machine learning model incorporates dense layers, ReLU activation functions, and dropout layers for regularization. The model aims to detect and classify internal threats with precision. Comparative analysis with other classification techniques, including random forest, naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, decision tree, logical regression, and gradient boosting, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving 100% accuracy in malware detection.
